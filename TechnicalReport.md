## Abstract
<p align="left">
&emsp;The overall objective of Poker Fanatic (PF) is to have a desktop application that can run a game of Five Card Poker against an intelligent AI to teach users strategies and basics of five card poker draw. The project consists of multiple classes and utilizes the JavaFx library to create a standalone application. All the code is written within eclipse oxygen, an IDE that I prefer because of its helpful auto fill options, vast library collections for java, and its debug mode. When developing PF, I first began by creating the deck of cards, using an array List I was able to create a list of 52 “Card” objects to be contained inside my Deck Class. Then I added the player class and opponent class, so it could interact with the deck. Using JavaFx I then was able to create an environment for the player and opponent to play against each other. <br>
&emsp;	The product that has been developed now has a list of features: Adjustable Opponent (easy, medium, hard), A graphic containing instructions on how to play poker, a graphic containing a ranked list of poker hand combinations, results post due to the points earned by the player and opponent, clickable cards with a nice highlight to see cards clicked, and fun sounds that help navigate and determine results of game. Users can launch the game, choosing the level of difficulty of the computer, deal out cards, make educated decision on cards to give back, and then see their results on the next page. If the user is satisfied with the level of difficulty they can continue to play if not there is an option to go back to the main page in order to change the computers difficulty.
