**Project Overview**
Poker Fanatic will satisify all card player's wants by allowing game after game without the hassle of shuffling a real deck of cards. Become a better Poker player by challenging yourself aginst Poker Fanatic's intelegent opponent!
The Features of my product will be implements based on fundamentals of functionality vs attractiveness. Meaning the project will aim for encapsulating all that it takes to have a legitament game of poker take place, then futher improvments will revovle around appearance, and or additional features to the game play. 
**Firstly,** the main objective is to have a program that can generate a card, formulate a deck of cards that are all labeled correctly as a normal deck of cards (minus the jokers), then to deal out these cards to the player and the computer. next the game must let the player give back cards he/she do not want then return the same amount of cards back. A player must only be able to give back 3 cards unless he/she has an Ace then that player can give back 4 cards not including the Ace they presented. Finally the program must establish who won the game based off the cards in their respective hands.
